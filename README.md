### Learning Objectives ✍️📚📝 ️

1. Learn how to [fetch()](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data) data from an API.

   - Recognize data fetching **takes time**.
   - `fetch()` - Used to make requests to API.
     - The **1st** argument is the [api endpoint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2122604/what-is-an-endpoint) we're fetching data from.
     - The **2nd** is [options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Supplying_request_options).
   - `json()` - Used to **parse to JS** object.

2. Learn what `async` & `await` are used for. [Read more detailed async & await](https://alligator.io/js/async-functions/).

   - Recognize they're used to make asynchronous.
     - `async` - Tells JS that a function is **asynchronous**.
     - `await` - Tells JS that this line will **take a few moments**.
